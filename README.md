# Hexagonal Architecture in Ruby

This project is a demonstration of the hexagonal architecture pattern implemented in Ruby. The hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters, promotes clean and maintainable software design by emphasizing separation of concerns and loose coupling between components.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** The application is structured into distinct layers, including domain logic, application services, and adapters for external dependencies.
  
- **Flexibility:** The hexagonal architecture allows for easy swapping of implementations for external dependencies, facilitating testing and evolution of the system.

- **Clean Code:** By enforcing clear boundaries between different parts of the system, the codebase remains clean and understandable.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and explore the source code. You can run the tests to see the hexagonal architecture in action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naigueldev/ruby-hexagonal.git
cd ruby-hexagonal
bundle install

ruby path/to/test_file.rb # Run test
```
